This is just static content - ensure you have Node installed and run [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server):
```
npx live-server
```

If making changes to the CSS, run [node-sass]() in watch mode as well:
```
npx node-sass --watch stylesheets-sass/ --output stylesheets/
```

You can just make changes, save and see the updated result in your local browser automatically.
